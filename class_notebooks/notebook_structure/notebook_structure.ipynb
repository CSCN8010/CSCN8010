    "# Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "A Machine Learning Notebook serves for multiple purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning**: It is a great way to learn and understand a new data, a new model, or a new technique.\n",
    "2. **Reproducibility with Code**: It is a way to make your work reproducible.\n",
    "3. **Communicating**: It is a way to communicate your findings and results to others (and to your future-self).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of a ML notebook is to explore a specific question, and summarize the findings in a clear and understandable way. This is why it is important to keep the notebook clean and organized. It should be easy to read and understand, such that the reader (e.g. your future-self) can follow the analysis and the conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A script is a set of instructions that are executed in a specific order. A notebook is a set of instructions that are executed in a specific order, but it also includes the results of the instructions (e.g. plots, tables, etc). This makes the notebook a great tool for communicating and sharing your work. A script or code is a great tool for reproducibility, but it is not as good for communicating findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a notebook depends on the specific question you are trying to answer. However, there are some common elements that are present in most notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction**: A brief introduction to the problem and the data.\n",
    "2. **Data Exploration**: An exploration of the data, to understand its structure and its properties.\n",
    "3. **Data Preprocessing**: The preprocessing of the data, to make it suitable for the model.\n",
    "4. **Modeling**: The definition and training of one or more models.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: The evaluation of the model, to understand how well it performs.\n",
    "6. **Conclusions**: A summary of the findings and the conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tips for writing a good ML notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keep it simple**: The notebook should be easy to read and understand. Avoid complex code or complex explanations.\n",
    "2. **Use comments**: Use comments to explain the code and the results. This will make it easier for the reader to understand your work.\n",
    "3. **Use plots and tables**: Use plots and tables to summarize the results. This will make it easier for the reader to understand your findings.\n",
    "4. **Use markdown**: Use markdown to structure the notebook. This will make it easier for the reader to follow the analysis.\n",
    "5. **Use sections**: Use sections to organize the notebook. This will make it easier for the reader to find specific parts of the analysis.\n",
    "6. **Use references**: Use references to cite the sources of the data and the techniques you are using. This will make it easier for the reader to find more information about the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of ML notebooks (tentative):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions): A notebook that explores the Titanic dataset and predicts which passengers survived the disaster.\n",
    "2. [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques): A notebook that explores the House Prices dataset and predicts the prices of houses.\n",
    "3. [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer): A notebook that explores the MNIST dataset and predicts the digits in the images."
