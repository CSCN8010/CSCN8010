    ">Web services are often protected with a challenge that's supposed to be easy for people to solve, but difficult for computers. Such a challenge is often called a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). CAPTCHAs are used for many purposes, such as to reduce email and blog spam and prevent brute-force attacks on web site passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Asirra (Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access) is a CAPTCHA that works by asking users to identify photographs of cats and dogs. This task is difficult for computers, but studies have shown that people can accomplish it quickly and accurately. Many even think it's fun! Here is an example of the Asirra interface:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Asirra is unique because of its partnership with Petfinder.com, the world's largest site devoted to finding homes for homeless pets. They've provided Microsoft Research with over three million images of cats and dogs, manually classified by people at thousands of animal shelters across the United States. Kaggle is fortunate to offer a subset of this data for fun and research. "

By the way, if you save it in the `./data/` folder it won't be tracked with Git, given that this folder appears in the `.gitignore` file. This is preferred, since `Git` and `Github` are not intended as data repositories.\n",
